## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are reusable instruction sets (`.md` files) that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner. Think of them as **expert playbooks** — each skill encodes domain knowledge, best-practice workflows, templates, and edge-case handling so that Claude can deliver consistent, high-quality output across any platform.

Skills work everywhere Claude does: **Claude Code** (CLI), **Claude Cowork** (web), and the **Claude API**.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Clone the full collection
git clone https://github.com/w95/awesome-claude-corporate-skills.git

# Copy a whole role to your project
cp -r awesome-claude-corporate-skills/02-finance-accounting/.  ~/.claude/skills/

# Or cherry-pick individual skills
cp -r awesome-claude-corporate-skills/02-finance-accounting/dcf-model ~/.claude/skills/

# Start Claude Code — skills load automatically
claude
```

### Claude Cowork (Web)

Select this repo folder as your workspace — all skills in scope become automatically available.

### Manual / API

Open any `SKILL.md` and use the instructions directly as a system prompt or reference material in API calls.
